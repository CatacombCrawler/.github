# 🏰 CatacombCrawler

Welcome to **CatacombCrawler** – a collection of dungeon crawler experiments, engines, and UIs.  
Our goal is to build a flexible dungeon crawling framework that supports multiple frontends (terminal, Pygame, maybe even web).

---

## 🎮 Projects

- [**Terminal Catacomb Crawler**](https://github.com/CatacombCrawler/terminal-catacomb-crawler)  
  A text-based dungeon crawler you can play in your terminal.  

(Coming soon: Pygame UI, other interfaces…)

---

## 🧩 Vision

CatacombCrawler is structured to separate **game logic** from **presentation**.  
That means we can experiment with different UIs while reusing the same core mechanics.  

- Core logic (monsters, loot, combat, maps)  
- Pluggable UIs (terminal, GUI, web)  
- Built with Python for easy hacking and experimentation
