# Hey, this is us 👋  
## The CatacombCrawler

Welcome to **CatacombCrawler** – a collection of dungeon crawler experiments, engines, and UIs.  
Our goal is to build a flexible catacomb-crawling framework that supports multiple frontends (terminal, Pygame, maybe even web).

### 🎯 What we’re building
- A reusable **core** for roguelike mechanics (maps, monsters, loot, combat)
- Multiple **UIs** that plug into the same core:
  - Terminal UI → [terminal-catacomb-crawler](https://github.com/CatacombCrawler/terminal-catacomb-crawler)
  - Pygame UI → _coming soon_
  - Web UI → _ideas welcome_

### 🤝 Contribute
- Open issues and PRs are welcome from the community (fork → PR).
- Direct pushes are limited to org members.
- Check open issues to get started.
